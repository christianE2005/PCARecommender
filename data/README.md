# Data directory

This directory is for storing data files used by the project.

## Structure

- `raw/` - Raw data files
- `processed/` - Processed data files
- `models/` - Saved model artifacts

## Note

Data files are generally not committed to version control (see `.gitignore`).
Add sample or example data files with prefix `sample_` or `example_` to include them in the repository.
